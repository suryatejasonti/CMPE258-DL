Less redundancy in the image is intended to better highlight the structures and features in the image to the learning algorithm. Typically, image whitening is performed using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique. More recently, an alternative called ZCA ( See Krizhevsky, 2009, Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images) shows better results and results in transformed images that keeps all of the original dimensions and unlike PCA, resulting transformed images still look like their originals. Can you do ZCA whitening transform with keras preprocessing ?"
